## Comment

I find this article super interesting because I can relate to it in several ways. I aspire to become a software engineer; however, similar to the interviewee in her younger years, I often find myself confused as to how I should proceed after my graduation. Lindsery Redd shared her journey since college up until now, and she spoke about what her jobs entailed, the interview process, and the biggest challenges she faced. 

An interesting piece of information I learned is that software engineering jobs typically entail more than just code. Although I knew that, it seems there is more meetings, planning and idea-pitching than I have expected. Furthermore, I was surprised to learn of "pair programming" where two programmers would code together simultaneosuly. I always assumed that working in a team meant each engineer would code individually, and then they would review each other's code. I always thought that was more productive from a company's perspective, but it seems pair programming makes solving problems faster. Finally, I have a better idea on the preperation needed for interviews, and what knowledge is expected from applicants (such as algotithms and data structures).
